<h1>What is Steam?</h1>
<p>Steam is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming developed by Valve Corporation. Although Steam is mostly known for its gaming software, containing a catalog of over 15,000 games, you can also find a variety of other types of software. These include Photo Editing, Video Production, Game Development, Animation and Modeling, and more. </p>

<h1>What is the Steam Web API?</h1>
<p>The Steam Web API was created to grant developers easy access to tons of data within Steam. This ranges from user data, application news, and a lot of statistical data. Unfortunately, the official <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/dev">Steam Web API Documentation</a> is quite underwhelming in terms of quality and ease-of-use.</p>
