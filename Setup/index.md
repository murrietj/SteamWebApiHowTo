# Register for an API key

As is the case with almost every web API, a unique key is required to make calls to methods within the API. This key serves as a way to identify who is making the API calls. To obtain a key, simply [fill out this form](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). Note that you must first have a Steam account to link with your key. You can sign in with an existing account or create a new one. Also note that you are limited to 100,000 calls per day with your key, as described in the [API Terms of Use](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms). For this reason, you will want to avoid sharing your key.
