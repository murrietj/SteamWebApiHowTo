# What this guide **WON'T** do

This site is not a tutorial on web development. It is assumed that the reader already has at least some experience with web programming. This guide will make use of the following programming topics that the user should have at least some understanding of:

- JavaScript Programming Language
- Node.js
- Object Oriented Programming
- Working with the DOM
- Making GET and POST Requests
- Making Asynchronous Calls
- JSON data format

All of the information found here isn't particularly specific to the languages/technologies listed above; it is simply what will be used in this guide for the examples. Any concepts relating to the Steam Web API should be easily transferrable.

This guide is also not intended to replace the official documentation nor was it meant to be a comprehensive documentation for the entire Steam Web API. This is simply meant to be an easy-to-understand getting started guide.
