# Summary
Let's briefly recap the steps we took in this guide to start using the [Steam Web API](http://steamcommunity.com/dev). First, we obtained an API key that allows us to make calls through GET requests. Because this API does not allow cross-origin requests, had to write a very basic server to handle the requests for us. Finally, we tested our server with a couple of example calls and examined the data in the response.

# What now?
By this point, you should have a good idea of how to start incorporating the [Steam Web API](http://steamcommunity.com/dev) into your application. The only thing left to do now is come up with a good use of the Steam data that is at your disposal. Now go out there and make something!
